Boats are not titled in Alabama. To register a boat you need a bill of sale. The information
needed to register the boat is as follows:

+ AL Number if Previously Registered in Alabama (last boat registration)
+ Decal Number if Registration is Current
+ Name and Address
+ Date of Birth
+  Social Security Number
+ Unexpired Driverâ€™s License (copy will be accepted)
+ Current and Valid Phone Number
+ Make of Boat
+ Length of Boat
+ Hull Number of Boat
+ Make of Motor
+ Horsepower of Motor
+ Serial Number of Motor

Should you purchase a boat that is currently registered in Alabama with a current decal, then that
decal would be transferred into the new owner's name. There are no penalties on boat
registrations or renewals. Boat registrations are not prorated. For example, if you register a boat
in May and your normal renewal month is August you would pay the same fee in May and
August.
