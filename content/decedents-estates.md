# GENERAL INFORMATION ABOUT THE ALABAMA SMALL ESTATES ACT AND SUMMARY DISTRIBUTIONS

## WHAT IS THE “ALABAMA SMALL ESTATES ACT”?
* This Act was passed in 1979 and later amended in 2009. It is codified as Ala. Code §§
  43-2-690, et seq. (1975).

* This Act provides a method, through a court proceeding, to distribute personal property
  of a deceased person in a summary distribution manner to a surviving spouse, or
  appropriate distributees of the decedent, without full probate administration.

## WHAT ARE THE VALUE LIMITS FOR SUMMARY DISTRIBUTION UNDER THIS ACT?
* The value of the entire decedent’s estate (personal property) shall not exceed $ 25,000.
  This figure is subject to adjustment by the State Finance Director on an annual basis for
  changes in the Consumer Price Index. Please note that real property cannot be
  administered under this Act. ( This adjusted figure equals $27,583.00 for 2014)

## WHAT IS REQUIRED TO INITIATE A SUMMARY DISTRIBUTION UNDER THE “ALABAMA SMALL ESTATES ACT” IN MARION COUNTY?
* A written petition under oath in proper form to be filed with the Probate Court by the
  surviving spouse of the decedent, or if none, by one or more of the distributees entitled to
  the personal assets of the estate.
* Proof of death of the subject party (decedent).
* Decedent must have been a resident of Marion County (confirm).
* Confirm that no petition is pending for administration or has been granted.
* The status at the date of death: Intestate (No Will) or Testate (Will).
* Iftestate, the original purported Will must be submitted to the Court.
* The names/addresses/ages of the surviving spouse, children and distributees.
* Details on claims and funeral expenses and the status on each (paid/unpaid).
* An itemized listing of the assets of the estate with a value of each asset.
Each item noted must be addressed in the petition by proper statement(s), with details and
explanations.

## ADDITIONAL MATTERS/COMMENTS:
* A heirship chart may be necessary, if requested by the Court.
* Publication costs will be incurred, to be paid directly by the petitioner. The Court will
  provide information on publication once the petition is filed and accepted.
* Upon compliance with all provisions of the “Alabama Small Estates Act”, an order and
  decree will be issued directing certain actions with regard to the decedent’s assets.
  including orders for distribution of said assets. Should it be determined by the Court that
  other proceedings are necessary before a final order can be entered, the attomey and
  petitioner will be advised.

Note: By Law, the Probate Court and its staff are not permitted to give legal advice or provide
any forms. If you are seeking action under the “Alabama Small Estates Act” and the summary
distribution procedures, it is suggested that you obtain the assistance of an attorney to prepare
and file the necessary paperwork with the Probate Court and provide representation generally for
this proceeding.

NOTICE FROM PROBATE COURT<br />
Paige Nichols Vick, Judge of Probate<br />
May 10, 2019<br />
Re: Small Estates/Summary Distribution Valuation Up-Date<br />
Pursuant to Ala. Code §43-2-692(b)(1), the State Finance Director has now issued
notice to the judges of probate revising the established limits for the administration of
small estates in response to adjustments in the Consumer Price Index. The figures provided
to the Probate Court are as follows:<br /><br />
For 2010 $25,410<br />
For 2011 $25,791<br />
For 2012 $26,616<br />
For 2013 $27,175<br />
For 2014 $27,583<br />
For 2015 $28,024<br />
For 2016 $28,052<br />
For 2017 $28,417<br />
For 2018 $29,014<br />
For 2019 $29,710<br />
<br />
In utilizing this information, the State Finance Director has stated:<br />
“Because the CPI-U for a calendar year is not published until January of the succeeding
year, the adjustment provided will reflect the change for the previous calendar year, but
will be effective for twelve months beginning the following March 1. For example, the value
of $25,791 established for 2011 will be used for the period March 1, 2011 through February
29th, 2012.”
