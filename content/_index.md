## WELCOME TO THE MARION COUNTY PROBATE COURT'S WEBSITE
Welcome to the Marion County Probate Court's website. This site has been developed to assist
the citizens of Marion County and other interested parties with matters that come within the
Court's areas of responsibility.

I was elected to serve as Marion County's Judge of Probate in 2018 and I took office in January,
2019. During the election process I learned that many of our citizens were not familiar with the
Probate Court or the duties and responsibilities of the Judge of Probate. Hopefully, you will gain
new insight and a better appreciation and understanding of the Marion County Probate Court by
reviewing this website.

The Judge of Probate deals with a number of important life issues and concerns and touches
persons residing in Marion County from "cradle to grave.” All residents of Marion County, no
matter their age, gender, race, social or economic status regularly come in contact with the
Probate Court. The Probate Court Is The Court Of The People.

My staff and I are dedicated to serving the citizens of Marion County. In every area of
responsibility assigned to the Judge of Probate, our goal is to be: (1) prompt; (2) courteous; (3)
fair-minded; (4) accurate; and (5) available when needed. With regard to judicial matters, the
mission of the Probate Court is to provide an impartial and accessible forum for the just, timely
and economic resolution of judicial proceedings within the Court's jurisdiction, so as to protect
individual rights and liberties and promote public trust and confidence. In all instances, the
Probate Court is committed to following applicable law.

This website is designed and offered to facilitate the mission of the Probate Court and these goals
being met. If the staff of the Probate Court or I can be of assistance to you, I trust that you will
not hesitate to contact us.
