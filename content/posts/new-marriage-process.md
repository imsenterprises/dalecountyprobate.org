### <span style="color: red">NEW</span> Marriage Process -  Alabama Act 2019-340
Effective August 29, 2019, the process for entering into a legal marriage in
Alabama changes, pursuant to Ala. Act 2019-340.  Under the new law, persons wishing to become married are no longer required to file an application for a
marriage license with the county probate court, and the courts will no longer
issue marriage licenses. Furthermore, all Alabama probate courts will now be
required to record marriage certificates. The Alabama Marriage Certificate form
represents a contractual agreement between the parties to the marriage,
completed by both parties and delivered to the probate court for recording. Once
properly completed and recorded, the marriage is valid. A wedding ceremony may
be performed for the parties, but solemnization is no longer required for a
recognized marriage in Alabama.

Information, forms and instructions are available on the Alabama Department of
Public
Health’s website at 
https://www.alabamapublichealth.gov/vitalrecords/marriage-certificates.html.
