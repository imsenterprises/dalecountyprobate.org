# CONSERVATORSHIP

A conservator is a person appointed by the Court to handle the financial
matters and property of a minor or adult person who is incapacitated. An
incapacitated person is someone who is physically and/or mentally unable to
care for themselves. In some cases, the person has a chronic use of drugs or
alcohol, is confined, or is being detained by a foreign power, or has
disappeared.

A Conservator may be appointed when a person can no longer handle property or
manage business affairs. The person might have property that will be wasted without a Conservator or be in need of funds to support them. In many cases,
the person has entered a nursing home and has become incapacitated and needs
his/her property to be sold in order to generate funds to support them while in
a nursing home.

Once the petition for appointment of a Conservator is filed for an adult, a
physician must examine the ward and render a report of his findings. In
addition, the Court will appoint a Court Representative and a Guardian Ad
Litem. In the case of a Minor the Court will only appoint a Guardian Ad Litem.
If the petition is granted, the Court will set a bond for the Conservator and
will set the first accounting period. The Conservator must file an inventory
with the Court within 90 days of appointment. The Conservator must keep a
record of all transactions, both incoming and outgoing, and give an accounting
as the Court directs.
