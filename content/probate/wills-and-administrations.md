# WILLS AND ADMINISTRATIONS

A will is a document which discloses how a person wishes his or her property to
be distributed after death. A will must meet certain legal requirements. The law
requires that a person making a will must be 18 years of age or older, of sound
mind and under no undue influence. The will must be signed by the maker and
witnessed by at least two people. After a will is written, it should be kept in
a safe place and the executors or personal representatives should be notified to
the location of said will.

A will should be probated within five (5) years after the person is deceased. 

If a person dies without a will, a Petition for Letters of Administration may be
filed. The petitioner must be a resident of the State and is required by law to
acquire a bond that will cover the amount of the estate plus one years estimated
growth.

After the Letters are issued, an inventory is required to be filed within 60
days after appointment.

Beginning September 1, 2019, Notice shall be given to the Alabama Medicaid
Agency in each Estate Case.
