# ADOPTIONS

Adoptions is the legal procedure through which a minor (18 years or younger) is recognized by laws as becoming the son or daughter of the adopting adult(s), and as having all of the rights and duties of such relationship, including the right of inheritance. There are several different types of adoptions, which include related, unrelated, agency-placed, or private-placement. Through adoption, the adoptive parent(s) have the same rights, duties and responsibilities of a natural parent. In all cases, the adoptive parent needs to contact an attorney to file the Petition for Adoption in the county where the minor resides, or where the agency is located.
