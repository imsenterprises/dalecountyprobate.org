# GUARDIANSHIP

A Guardian is a person appointed by the Court to make decisions concerning a
person’s physical needs. An incapacitated person is someone who is physically
and/or mentally unable to care for themselves. In some cases, the person has a
chronic use of drugs or alcohol, is confined, or is being detained by a foreign
power, or has disappeared.

A Guardian may be appointed when a person can no longer makes decisions
regarding their personal needs. In some cases a Guardian might become necessary
because the person might have suffered a stroke or other illness and be unable
to respond or make medical decisions alone.

Once a petition for appointment of a Guardian is filed, a physician must examine
the ward and submit a written report to the Court. If Temporary Letters are
being requested, a physician’s report must accompany the Petition. In addition,
the Court will appoint a Court Representative and a Guardian Ad Litem.
