# ADOPTIONS

## WHAT IS AN ADOPTION?
Adoption is the legal procedure through which a minor is recognized by law as being the
son or daughter of the adopting adult(s) and as having all of the rights and duties of such
relationship, including the right of inheritance. The adoptee takes the name designated by
the petitioner.

## WHO MAY ADOPT?
Any person who is 19 years or older may adopt a minor child. The Alabama Adoption Code
specifically prohibits discrimination in granting adoptions on the basis of marital status or
age.

A minor, defined as being a person under the age of 19 years, may be adopted.

## WHAT STEPS ARE USUALLY INVOLVED IN AN ADOPTION?

1. Preplacement investigation (may petition Court or go to Department of Human  Resources or a licensed child placement agency).
2. All necessary consents and/or relinquishments concerning the adoption are obtained.
3. Guardian ad litem is appointed when either natural parent of the adoptee is a minor or in the event of a contested hearing.
4. Petition Court for authority to pay fees or expenses.
5. Placement of child with petitioner.
6. File petition for adoption 30 days after placement.
7. Serve notice or obtain waiver of notice on or from all parties entitled to notice of the adoption.
8. Post placement investigation.
9. Hearings.
10. Affidavits of non-payment.
11. Accounting of disbursements.

## WHAT IS A PRE-PLACEMENT INVESTIGATION?
Investigation conducted for the purpose of determining the suitability of each petitioner and
the home in which the adoptee will be placed, The investigation will include a criminal
background search and will focus on any other circumstances relevant to the placement of
the adoptee.

## IS IT ALWAYS NECESSARY TO HAVE A PRE-PLACEMENT INVESTIGATION?

Alabama Code §§26-10A-27; 26-10A-28 (1975).

## WHOSE CONSENT TO THE ADOPTION IS REQUIRED?

1. The adoptee, if 14 years or older, unless mentally incapable of giving consent.

4. The agency to whom the adoptee has been relinquished or which holds permanent custody, except that a court
  may grant an adoption without the agency's consent when it would be in the child's best interest and the
  agency's withholding of consent is unreasonable.
5. The putative father if known; provided that he responds within 30 days after receiving notice of the adoption.

## CAN A MINOR CONSENT TO THE ADOPTION OF HIS OR HER CHILD?
Yes, however, prior to such consent the Court must appoint a guardian ad litem to represent
the minor parent's interests. A minor who is 14 years of age or older can nominate a
guardian ad litem to protect his or her interests

## CAN A PERSON REVOKE A CONSENT TO ADOPTION EXECUTED BY HIM OR HER DUE TO THE FACT THAT AT THE TIME THE CONSENT WAS GIVEN THAT PERSON WAS A MINOR?
No, a consent or relinquishment executed by a parent who is a minor shall not be subject to
revocation by reason of such minority.

## WHEN, WHERE AND IN WHAT FORM MUST A CONSENT OR RELINQUISHMENT FOR ADOPTION BE GIVEN?
A consent or relinquishment for adoption may be given at any time. The prebirth consent of
the mother must be signed or confirmed before a probate judge. All other prebirth or post-
birth consent or relinquishments must be signed or confirmed hefore the probate judge or
clerk of the Probate Court, or someone appointed by the agency conducting the
investigation or a notary public. The consent or relinquishment must be in substantially the
same form as provided in the Alabama Adaoption Code and must be in writing and signed by
the person consenting or relinquishing


## WHEN MAY A CONSENT OR RELINQUISHMENT BE WITHDRAWN?
A consent or relinquishment may be withdrawn for any reason five days after the birth of
the adoptee or five days after the signing of the consent or relinquishment whichever occurs
later, The time to withdraw the consent or relinquishment can be expanded to 14 days if the
Court finds that such delay is reasonable under the circumstances and is in the best interest .
of the child.

office of the agency or institution having guardianship or custody of the minor is located.
‘WHEN IS A PETITION FOR ADOPTION FILED?

The adoption petition must be filed within 30 days after the minor is placed with the
prospective adoption parent(s) for adoption. If the person seeking the adoption is a
stepparent or relative of the adoptee then the adoptee must reside with the petitioner for a
vear, The Probate Court, for good cause, may waive the residency requirement in stepparent
or related adoptions.

## CAN I PAY THE PARENT OF A MINOR OR UNBORN CHILD FOR THE CHILD?
No! An offer to make such payment is a Class A misdemeanor, to receive payment for a
person's consent to adoption is a Class C felony.

## WHAT EXPENSES CAN I PAY?
A person seeking to adopt a child may pay maternity-connected medical or hospital
expenses and necessary living expenses of the mother preceding and during pregnancy and
during pregnancy related incapacity as long as such payments are made as an act of charity
and such payment is not contingent upon placement of the child for adoption. All fees and
expenses, including legal, medical, investigative, or other legitimate professional fees may
anly be paid with the Probate Court's approval.

## HOW CONFIDENTIAL IS AN ADOPTION?
The Alabama Adoption Cade was designed to keep an adoption as confidential as possible.

1. Before a final adoption decree is rendered the only people with access to the adoption
  records are the petitioner, the petitioner's attorney, the preplacement investigator.
  and any attorney appointed or retained by the minor being adopted. No other person has
  access to the adoption recards unless they obtain a court order after - showing good
  cause to allow them to inspect the records.
2. All adoption hearings are confidential and held in a closed court proceeding open only
  to the interested parties and their counsel, except with permission of the Court.
3. After the final decree of adoption is entered, all documents pertaining to the adoption
  are sealed and identifying information cannot be obtained by anyone except the adoptee
  under limited circumstances. (see below).
4. The natural parent(s) may consent in Writing under oath to disclosure of identifying
  information to the adoptee when such adoptee reaches the age of 19. The adoptee upon
  reaching the age of 19 may petition the Prabate Court for disclosure of identifying
  information. Such information will not be released to the adoptes without the natural
  parent consent unless the court determines it is best after weighing the interests of the
  parties involved.

## WHAT IS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN AN ADOPTION BY A STEPPARENT OR CLOSE FAMILY MEMBER AND OTHER ADOPTIONS?
There is usually a lot less formality and requirements when the adoptee is being adopted by
a stepparent or close family member. Unlike all other adoptions, usually no preplacement or
postplacement investigation nor accounting of the cost relating to the adoption are required.
In order to be exempt from these requirements, the adoptee must have lived with the
petitioner for at least one year.
