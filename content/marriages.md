## ALABAMA MARRIAGE CERTIFICATE


### <span style="color: red">NEW</span> Marriage Process -  Alabama Act 2019-340
Effective August 29, 2019, the process for entering into a legal marriage in
Alabama changes, pursuant to Ala. Act 2019-340.  Under the new law, persons wishing to become married are no longer required to file an application for a
marriage license with the county probate court, and the courts will no longer
issue marriage licenses. Furthermore, all Alabama probate courts will now be
required to record marriage certificates. The Alabama Marriage Certificate form
represents a contractual agreement between the parties to the marriage,
completed by both parties and delivered to the probate court for recording. Once
properly completed and recorded, the marriage is valid. A wedding ceremony may
be performed for the parties, but solemnization is no longer required for a
recognized marriage in Alabama.

Information, forms and instructions are available on the Alabama Department of
Public
Health’s website at 
https://www.alabamapublichealth.gov/vitalrecords/marriage-certificates.html.

#### 1. When does the new law go into effect?
The new law, which eliminates the issuance of marriage licenses, is effective
Thursday, August 29, 2019.

#### 2. What steps must a couple complete to be considered married under Alabama law?
1. Fill out the Alabama Marriage Certificate form provided by the Alabama
  Department of Public Health.
2. Sign the form and have the signatures notarized.
3. Submit the form to an Alabama probate court within 30 days of the signatures
  of the parties.

#### 3. Where does a couple obtain the new Alabama Marriage Certificate form?
Once the new Act goes into effect, you can access the new Alabama Marriage
Certificate form online at the Alabama Department of Public Health’s website at
http://www.alabamapublichealth.gov/vitalrecords/marriage-certificates.html. The
Marion County Probate Court will also place a link to the form on its website:
www.marioncountyprobate.org. These links will also take you to instructions for
completing and filing the new forms. In addition, Marion County Probate Court
will provide blank forms for pick up at the office

#### 4. When is the effective date of the marriage?
As long as the Marriage Certificate form is submitted to probate court within
30 days of the signatures of the parties, the effective date of the marriage is
the date that both parties sign the Marriage Certificate form. If the spouses
sign on different dates, the date of the marriage will be the latter of the
dates of the spouses’ signatures.

#### 5. Are couples still required to have a marriage ceremony?
No. The new Act eliminates any requirement of a ceremony. Couples may still have
ceremonies, of course.

#### 6. Are couples required to go to an Alabama probate court PRIOR to getting married?
No. Unlike the previous law’s requirement that a couple apply for a license
PRIOR to getting married, the new Act requires that the Alabama Marriage
Certificate form be filed with an Alabama probate court AFTER the couple is
married.

#### 7. How old must a person be to marry in Alabama?
To get married without parental consent, a person must be at least 18 years old.
Anyone under the age of 18, but at least 16 years old may marry in Alabama as
long as he or she has parental consent. Anyone under the age of 16 years old is
not permitted to marry.

#### 8. Must both parents consent for a minor to marry?
No. Unlike the previous law’s requirements that BOTH parents consent to the
minor being married, the new Act only requires that ONE parent consent to the
minor’s marriage.

#### 9. How does a parent provide consent for a minor to marry?
There are two versions of the Marriage Certificate form. There is one form for
persons who are 18 years of age and older, and a second version of the form for
persons who are 16 to 17 years of age and require the consent of a parent or
guardian to enter into marriage. The consenting parent(s) or guardian(s) must
complete page 2 of the Marriage Certificate form, entitled “Affidavit of Consent
for Marriage of a Minor.”

#### 10. How much is the fee to get married?
The fee to record the Marriage Certificate form is $70.00 in Marion County. The
fee must be paid by cash, money order, or credit card. No checks will be
accepted to record Marriage Certificate forms. A certified copy of the Marriage
Certificate is an additional $4. If a couple requests that a notary of the
Marion County Probate Office notarize any signature, the fee is $5 per signature.

#### 11. How do I obtain certified copies of my Marriage Certificate?
If you would like a certified copy of the Marriage Certificate, you may obtain a
copy from the Marion County Probate Office This can be obtained immediately
after its been recorded. The fee for a certified copy is $4.00 for a standard
Marriage Certificate, and $5.00 for a Marriage Certificate that includes
parental consent.
Copies may also be obtained from the Alabama Department of Public Health’s
Center for Health Statistics. Once the certificate has been submitted by the
probate court and received and filed in the Center for Health Statistics, you
may request certified copies of your certificate through that office. For
instructions on how to request certified copies of your certificate in person,
online, by mail, or by phone, visit the Center’s website at
http://www.alabamapublichealth.gov/vitalrecords/marriage-certificates.html. You
may also call the Center for Health Statistics at (334) 206-5418.

#### 12. What happens if the form is not submitted to probate court within 30 days of the signatures of the parties?
The marriage would be considered invalid, and the spouses would need to start
the process over. They would complete a new Marriage Certificate form and
deliver it to the probate court within the 30 days required by law.


#### 13. Do both spouses have to come together to probate court to bring the Marriage Certificate form to be recorded?
We have requested clarification from the Alabama Attorney General as to whether
one spouse or a third party may deliver the Marriage Certificate form to probate
court to be recorded, and whether the Marriage Certificate form can be mailed to
probate court in lieu of hand delivery. Until we receive that clarification,
both spouses need to bring in the completed Marriage Certificate form in person
to probatecourt to record it. Once we receive a response from the Attorney
General on this and other matters, we will update this FAQ document on our
website. We will also publish a copy of the Attorney General’s Opinion on our
website.

#### 14. Am I required to record the Marriage Certificate form in the county where I or my intended spouse reside?
No. You may record an Alabama Marriage Certificate form in any Alabama probate
court.

#### 15. Will probate court provide a notary to notarize the Marriage Certificate form?
Staff at the Mobile County Probate Court are not permitted to notarize documents
for the public. Notaries are available at many locations, including banks,
public libraries, UPS stores, AAA, and some pharmacies. Your personal bank
should provide notary services for free, but there may be a charge for notary
services at some of the other listed locations. Under Alabama law, a notary
public is able to charge $5 for each signature that is notarized, and for each
official act performed.
