## <u>NOTICE OF CHANGE IN MARRIAGE LICENSE LAW</u>
### (updated 8/28/2019)

COMMENCING AUGUST 29, 2019, ACT 2019-340 will replace existing state statutory marriage law, and the Judge of Probate will no longer issue a MARRIAGE LICENSE to two persons desiring to unite in marriage.  The new law abolishes the requirement for a license and, while couples may have a ceremony if they so desire, a ceremony will no longer be required.  This new law applies to every county in the State of Alabama.  

Please note that other requirements relating to marriage, such as being of minimum age and not presently married, were not changed by the new law.
  
The new law mandates that two persons desiring to unite in marriage may do so
by:
* completing the required form entitled <u>Alabama Marriage Certificate</u> provided by the State, which must be signed by both parties, dated, and notarized.   Notary <u>must</u> place his/her seal on the form.
* delivering the completed original form to the Probate Office for recording <u>within 30 days of the date of the signatures and notarization</u>;
* paying the required fee. 


<u>The effective date of the marriage is the latter of the dates of the
signatures of both parties.</u>    <u>Important Note:</u>   If you are having a
marriage ceremony, and want that date to be your legal date of marriage, please
make sure the Alabama Marriage Certificate form is completed, signed, dated,
and notarized on the same date as your ceremony.   The parties have the
responsibility to present the completed original form to the Probate Office for
recording within 30 days of the signatures of the parties and same being
notarized.   The recording of the required form will establish legal
recognition of the marriage. The original Alabama Marriage Certificate form
filed with the Probate Office will be forwarded by the Judge of Probate to the
Office of Vital Statistics, as required by the new law.   The Probate Office
will provide a certified copy of the recorded Alabama Marriage Certificate form
to the parties for their personal records; cost $5.00 for the first copy and
$3.00 each additional.

The Alabama Marriage Certificate forms and instructions are available in a
fillable pdf format and may be printed, once all required fields have been
completed.   To access the new Alabama Marriage Certificate form and
instructions online, at the Alabama Department of Public Health’s website:
