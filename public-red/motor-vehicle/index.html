fee is no longer collected, and all other fees are to the credit card processor.

Tags renewals can be processed up until midnight of the last day of the month.
Anyone renewing after the last day of the month will be charged a $15.00 penalty
plus interest and will be required to come into the office.

Decals, tags, and tag receipts will be mailed out on the next business day after
they are renewed. A printable receipt will be available for proof of online
payment only; it is not to be used as a valid tag receipt. Your official receipt

In order to receive a voucher, one of the following criteria must be met:

theft without recovery or other transfer. Documents to support this criteria:

event that a credit voucher cannot be applied toward taxes due, then a receipt
for credit is issued (in other words, a check is issued).
