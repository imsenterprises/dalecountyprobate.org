Real Property

Property (ad valorem) taxes are taxed on real and/or business personal property.
Real property includes land and improvements. An improvement is defined as
anything that adds value to real property such as a house, manufactured home,
swimming pool, chicken house, barn, etc.

Business Personal Property

Business personal property refers to items which are used in any business and
are movable or not permanently fixed to the land.

All persons, corporations, partnerships, etc. owning business personal property,
aircraft, commercial mobile or portable units are subject to ad valorem tax.
The property must be listed and assessed in the Revenue Commissioner&rsquo;s Office
after October 1, but no later than December 31 each year. Failure to make an
assessment by the 3rd Monday in January will result in a 10% penalty and fees
being added to the tax bill. All business personal property is appraised by the
County Revenue Commissioner for taxes, based on the cost new and allowance for
depreciation due to age.

Manufactured Homes

The Alabama Manufactured Home Act (91-694), signed into law July 18, 1991,
changed the way manufactured homes are treated for tax and revenue purposes in
Alabama. Under the Act those manufactured homes located on the owner&rsquo;s property
and not held for rent or lease will be assessed on the real property tax rolls
in the Revenue Commissioner&rsquo;s Office. All others must be registered. Proof of
ownership, along with a description that includes size, ID number, year made
and model of the manufactured home should be brought to the Revenue
Commissioner’s Office to make an assessment. The owner will receive a decal to
display on the right front corner as proof that the taxes are paid. A homestead
exemption may be claimed if you own the manufactured home, the property and
live there as your principle residence as of October I. Proof of title (20
years or newer model) and that sales tax has been paid must be provided at time
of assessment/registration. All manufactured homes must be registered or
assessed within 30 calendar days of purchase. Renewal of manufactured home
registrations is October/November each year. There is a $10.00 penalty for late
registration. Persons over 65 or permanently and totally disabled should
request exemption information prior to registration/renewal.

Property Assessment

Responsibility for assessing property (telling the revenue commissioner you
have bought property and what it is used for) lies with the owner to see that
all the necessary steps have been completed. As a minimum the following steps
should be done:


Record your deed in Probate Office.
Assess the property in Revenue Commissioner&rsquo;s Office.
Claim any exemption due you. Make sure all of this is done not later than
December 31 for all property purchased by October 1. Please report promptly
all address changes.
Make sure the taxes are current and paid on the purchased property.


Each taxpayer is required by Alabama Law (Code 40-7-1) to provide a complete
list of all their owned property. The person acquiring property is responsible
for reporting to the Revenue Commissioner a complete legal description of the
property and should at the time claim any exemptions for which he or she is
eligible. The Revenue Commissioner should be furnished a correct mailing
address for all properties. The property owner must report any changes in
ownership to the Revenue Commissioner.

All assessments as of October 1 of each year are due and payable the following
October 1. Real and personal property taxes are paid in arrears. Taxes on motor
vehicles are paid forward and are paid throughout the year based upon the first
letter of your last name.

Property Appraisal

The Revenue Commissioner is responsible for determining property value, which
must, by law, be set according to &ldquo;fair and reasonable market value.&rdquo; Your
property is probably not for sale but the county appraiser must set the value
of the property as if it were &ldquo;sold&rdquo; in an &ldquo;arms length&rdquo; transaction between a
&ldquo;willing buyer and a willing seller,&rdquo; neither being under any pressure to buy
or sell. If you feel your property value is incorrect you may file a written
protest with the Lowndes County Board of Equalization. Upon your appeal, if
time permits, you will be contacted by the county appraiser to review your
valuation. If, after this review, you are still not satisfied with your
valuation, a hearing will be set for you to formally meet with the Board of
Equalization to present information you feel justifies a change in value.
Following this hearing you will be notified of the decision of the Board of
Equalization. You may appeal to Circuit Court within 30 days of their decision.
In order to preserve your right to carry the appeal process to Circuit Court,
taxes must be paid by December 31, or a bond filed in Circuit Court in double
the amount of taxes due.

Adding or Removing Improvements

Improvements are defined as &ldquo;anything that adds value to land&rdquo; (house,
manufactured home, swimming pool, garage, chicken house, barn, etc.).

The law requires that owners, or their agent, must come to the Revenue
Commissioner&rsquo;s Office no later than December 31 to sign a new assessment
officially reporting any improvements made to or any removal of structures
or features from their property, on or before October 1 of that year. Examples
of improvements that are assessable would include new structures or additions,
swimming pools, extensive repairs, remodeling, or renovations; adding a
fireplace, extra bath, patio, deck, carport, garage, etc. However such things
as re-roofing, minor repairs and painting, (normal maintenance type items),
would not require a reassessment.

Homestead Exemptions

A Homestead Exemption is a tax break a property owner may be entitled to if he
or she owns a single-family residence and occupies it as their primary
residence on the first day of the tax year (Oct. 1) for which they are applying.
A Homestead must be requested at the Revenue Commissioner’s office, it is not
automatic. The following are the four types of Homestead Exemptions:


Regular Homestead 1 is available to all citizens of Alabama who own and
occupy a single-family residence; including manufactured homes, as their
primary residence and use this property for no other purposes. The amount of
the exemption is $4,000.00 in assessed value for state taxes and $2,000.00 in
assessed value for county taxes.
Homestead Exemption 2 (ACT 91) is for persons over age 65 with an annual
adjusted gross income of less than $12,000 on their most recent state income
tax return. This exemption is for all State taxes and County taxes up to
$5,000.00 in assessed value.
Homestead Exemption 3 (ACT 48) is an exemption from all property taxes for
persons over age 65 whose taxable income on their most recent Federal Tax
Return was $12,000 or less or who are permanently and totally disabled. Proof
of permanent and total disability can be the following: 2 physician letters
stating you are permanently and totally disabled (One doctor must be
currently treating you for the disability) or proof from one of the following:
Social Security Administration, Department of Veterans Affairs, Private
Company from which you are drawing a disability pension.
Homestead Exemption 4 (ACT 91-B) is for persons over 65, regardless of income.
This exemption is for the total assessed value of state tax and up to
$2,000.00 of assessed value of county tax up to 160 acres.
Exemptions should be applied for before December 31 of each year based upon
status (owner occupied, age 65 or totally and permanently disabled) of
property and owner on October 1. Once you receive an exemption for disability
or age you must claim this exemption each year. A notice will be mailed to
you to make this claim; however it is your responsibility to make sure the
claim is done each year. The exemption has to be removed if the claim is not
made each year.


Current Use Exemption

Owners of 5 acres or more of farmland, pastureland or timberland that is
producing agricultural products, livestock or wood products may apply for
current use exemption. This exemption allows for property to be assessed at
less than market value when used only for the purposes specified. Any owner of
eligible property must make a formal application to the Revenue Commissioner&rsquo;s
Office if he or she wishes to claim current use. The current use applications
may be obtained from the Revenue Commissioner&rsquo;s Office at any time of the year,
but under the law they must be filed with the Revenue Commissioner&rsquo;s Office no
later than December 31, for it to apply in the following tax year. After
current use has been granted, the owner who made application for current use
does not have to re-apply for subsequent years. However, if the property
ownership is transferred or the name has been changed by deed or will, the new
owner will have to file an application for current use or his or her taxes will
be based on fair market value rather than current use values.
